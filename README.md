# SPOTIPIE

Roger Roig - BCN Data analytics Bootcamp February 2019

### Overview

This project aims at building a model that clasifies a song on whether I like it or not.

### Data Preparation

All data used for this project has been retrieved using Spotipy. 
Spotipy is a lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API.
The database consists of over 5000 songs with the id of the song and main song features (including: acousticness, danceability, duration, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, speechiness, tempo, time signature and valence) and a target value, which determines whether a song has been liked (1) or not(0).

### Data Ingestion & Database

The database for this project consists of one unique table for over 5000 songs, as specified in the data preparation section

### Data Wrangling and Cleaning

Duplicate songs were eliminated. 

### Data Analysis



### Model Training and Evaluation

Different classification models are going to be tried in order to obtain the best possible classification: logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree and random forest.

### Conclusion


### What are the next steps?
